# CS-255

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client is DriverPass and they want to create a site that can help customers with test prep and driving classes to help the customer pass their driving test. They wanted the system to be able to allow access to test review and quizzes as well as booking personal driving instructors to help with the driving portion. 
What did you do particularly well?
I beleive I did well in the UML designs in showing the classes and actors. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise more of the first project where it asks for the requirements the DriverPass owers wanted and better articulating what more they wanted. 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Making sure that what was really important and feasable was implimented into the system. Its important to makes sure the user is getting what the want and making sure that it is also user friendly to operate. 
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Breaking it down into sections to make sure all aspects are being covered. I would make sure to do a checklist of what is needed in regards to completing the system.
